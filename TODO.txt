TODO :
- Fix the problem with wxWidgets 2.9
- Add a visible warning if the wrong firmware is loaded on the Arduino
- Fix the protocol conflict which prevent the loading of the EEPROM the first time the user ask for it (it seems to be a problem with the command END_SYSEX which is not received )
- Manage the reset button of the Arduino (Loading from the Arduino ? Just reinitialize some variables ? ... )
- Make it possible to launch webmapper from the firmata_mapper GUI interface ?
- Fix the problem of crash when the name of the save has one character or more than nine
